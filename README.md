Description: The system aims to capture a group photo of students and then clip individual images using feature detection and extraction. The extracted images were compared with the database images using pre-defined libraries like face recognition, os, matplotsys, plt to recognize the faces. The attendance of the identified students is recorded in MySQL along with the student details. Overall, 98% accuracy achieved displaying the exact image and details of the student.

Technology: Python 3.5, MySQL
